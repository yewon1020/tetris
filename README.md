## Introduction
Tetris is game which you have to stack the block. You can get point and there's no end(but if you stack the block until the top, you are out!).
## How to play 
You have to stack the block and clear the lines. You can use the direction keys to move the block. 
When you press the up key, you can turn the block. Also, when you press the space key, you can move the block to the bottom at once. 
If you clear the lines, you can get point. In 1 line, you get 100 points. When you reach 500, the level will increase.
Good luck!
